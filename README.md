## Prerequisites

[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

## Architecture
I follow an architecture based on Modules, each module could be Eager or Lazy. Inside of each module you could see
`components|directives|pipes|services|classes|guards|interfaces|enums` folders to facilitate the development process.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deploy

The app will be deployed automatically after each merge or push to master branch

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
